# Pre-Lecture Questions Oct. 30
1. What is the correct sequence of segments in a program memory stack from low address to high address?  ANS. Text, Data, BSS, Heap, Stack
2. What's the main goal for the atttacker in a stack overflow attack? ANS. To override the return address
3. In a stack overflow attack, an attacker often injects malicious code into the stack, and overwrites the return address to point to the malicious code. But one challenge is working out the address for the malicious code. Which of the following can increase the attacker's chance of success? ANS. Filling NOP
4. What are the countermeasures to prevent buffer overflow?
ANS. 
**Always use safer functions like strncpy()**
Always remember to check the input size before calling strcpy()
**Enable address space layout randomization
Stack-Guard
Use non-executable stack**
5. In StackGuard, Guard must be a secret value unknown to the attacker. ANS. Yes
6. 
# Memory Allocation
Stack: High to Low
Heap: Low to High
Heap overflow resulting stack smashing


# Program memory stack
From Low to High:
1. Text segment: Executable code of the program
2. Data segment: Static/Global variables that are initialized by the programmer
3. Block Started by Symbol, (BSS) segment: uninitialized static/global variables
4. Heap: Dynamic memory allocation
5. Stack: Local variables defined inside functions, data related to functions calls (ex. return address, argumnets)
## Example Code
![Code Example](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/8-mHCZn5ONQ0RzZrvggapaNWc2S9JnIsvRBoR3j6vBLjkCUKzcrJeWssFKmW3YZrUGtswxvBRnxuB2EXY3a-nI-rJ1VV2wDjU8ANoUzyAD8XaueCi5ZuYmxqz57aMKFQuXXLJ6epJcSaAjjJfJTStaHj=s2048)
x: Data Segment
y: BSS segment
ptr: Heap
a, b, ptr: Stack

## Stack memory layout
Suppose: 
void func(int a, int b){
	int x , y;
	x = a + b;
	y = a - b;
}
### Stack:  From High to Low
Value of b
Value of a
Return Addr
Previous Frame Pointer
Value of x
Value of y
==Explained How assembly code works==

### Function inside function
a(), b(), c()
b is  inside a, c is inside b

Stack: From High address to low address
a()
b()
c()

After each function is executed, the corresponding stack will be released. 

### Why stack overflow dangerous? Ex. Copy a String in C
strcpy() only copies the string before `\0`
`char a[40] = "Hello world \0 Extra string"`
strcpy(b, a) only copies "Hello world" to b

### Example of copy buffer overflow
```
void foo(char *str*){
	char b[12].
	strcpy(buffer, str)
}
If str is larger than 12, it will cause a overflow
```
It would influence higher level parts, like return Address, pointer as shown here.  [[4.1 Software Buffer Overflow (After Mac)#Stack From High to Low]]


## How Malicious Input works
Task A: Find the distance between the base of the buffer and return address
Task B: Find the address to place the malicious code (e.g., shellcode)
Random guess: Takes 2^32 times attempt to find the correct address; 
**So, how to make it more possible to help attackers find the right address?** 
### Technique 1: Fill NOP
- NOP does nothing
- It just moves on to the next instruction
### Technique 2: spraying return address

Hard to calculate, because compiler might add some bytes

### Shellcode

Goal of attackers: 
Use execve(“/bin/sh”, argv, 0) to run shell
## Counter measure
### Principle of ASLR(Address Space Layout Randomization)

### StackGuard (Cowan et al, USENIX Security’98)
StackGuard 的工作原理是在栈上的每个函数的局部变量和函数的返回地址之间放置一个“canary”值（哨兵值）。当函数执行返回操作之前，会检查这个哨兵值是否被改变。如果哨兵值被更改（这通常意味着有一个溢出发生），程序会立即终止，从而防止潜在的恶意代码执行。
所以说，这个canary不能被知道。

### Non-executable stack

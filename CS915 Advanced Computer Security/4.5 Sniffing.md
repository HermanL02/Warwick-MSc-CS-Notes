# Promiscuous mode 
If a sniffer program is registered with the kernel, it will be able to see all the packets.

# Wireless network 
- Wireless network has different name of Promiscuous mode as monitor mode
- But WIFI card cannot capture different channels
NIC: Network Interface Card
Wireless NIC (无线网卡)

# BSD Packet Filter (BPF)
- Eg. A filter can only allow packets from port 22
- It is possible to have multiple filters'
# Sniffing
Means capture all the live data that flows across a network

# UDP Server
Receiving Packets Using Socket
- Create socket
- Provide information about server
- Receive packets
# Sniffer 
Receiving Packets Using Sockets
- Create raw socket
- Use Promiscuous mode
- Wait for packets

# Drawbacks
- This program is not portable across different operating systems. 
- Setting filters is not easy (not included in the code examples)
- The program does not explore any optimization to improve performance.
- The PCAP (packet capture) library was thus created.
- It still uses raw sockets internally, but its API is standard across all platforms. OS specifics are hidden by PCAP’s implementation.
- Allows programmers to specify filtering rules using human readable Boolean expressions.

# Packet Sniffing using pcap API


# Packet Spoofing
Why raw sockets? 
- With raw socket, we construct the entire packet in a buffer including the IP header before sending it out via the socket

# Spoofing using ICMP packet

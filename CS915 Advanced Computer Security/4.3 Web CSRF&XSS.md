**Real UID is equal to the user ID**
Real UID is equal to the program owner's ID
Effective UID is qual to the user ID
**Effective UID is equal to the program owner's ID**

1. What is a same-site request? ANS. A page from a website sends a request to the same website
2. Which of the following are cross-site requests? ANS.  
**A page from a website sends a request to a different website**
You open a different browser tab and access a web page
**You click a facebook like button from a wordpress blog**
**You click a link from the Google search results**
3. What will happen when you load the following page? ![[Pasted image 20231107110935.png]]
ANS. An HTTP get request will be sent together with a session cookie
4. What is the fundamental reason causing the cross-site request forgery attack? ANS. The server can't distinguish same-site and cross-site requests
5. How to defend against CSRF attacks?
Don't click cross-site web links
The browser attaches a referer header to indicate which page is sending the request
**The server sets a same-site cookie
The server can add secret tokens in the web page**
# Contents
## CSRF 
- Cross Site Request Forgery 
- Performed on HTTP GET and HTTP POST
- Countermeasures
## XSS 
- Two types of XSS attacks
- Countermeasures

# Requests 
Same-site request: 
A page sends HTTP request and back to the same website. 

Cross-site request: 
A page sends HTTP request to a different website. 

# Cookie 
- A packet of info
- From server to client (First Authorize)
- From client to server (When client access the website)
# Cross-Site Request Problems
The same cookies if send from different devices, the website cannot know. 

# Cross-Site Requests Forgery Attack
1. The attacker forge a website
2. The victim log to this fake website
3. The website send cookies to user
4. The attacker use cookies to log to the real website

# CSRF Attack on Requests

## GET request
Example: http://www.bank32.com/transfer.php?to=3220&amount=500
The attacker send this request to the server through the victim's session cookies. 

Easy way to understand: Phishing buttons 钓鱼按钮
## POST request 
Post request = Form Submit
So if the user clicks the submit button, the post request will be sent. 

Same above, use JavaScript to submit the form automatically. 

# Cause

- Server cannot distinguish the source of the request
- Browser would know the difference
# Countermeasures 
## Referer Header (Done by browser)

- HTTP Header contains the address of the web page from where the request is generated. 
- Server knows whether it is sent from its own website
- 停止使用: Exposures users browser history
## Same-Site Cookies (Done by browser)
1. Same-Site variable inside the browser
2. Can be set to Strict or Lax
## Secret Token (Done by browser)
- Embeds a secret value
- After request initiated from the page, the secret value is stored in the request. 
- The server checks this value every time to see if this request is cross-site
- So guaranteed not shared to the other site (through browser's policy)
# XSS 
## Cross-Site Scripting Attack
Attacker inject code to the victims browser via a target website. 
# Non-persistent (Reflected) XSS
The script is embedded in a request made to the server (like in a URL or form submission)
1. The script in the link, and passed to the server
2. The server does not handle the script in the message, then reflect it on the user browser. 
3. It can hijack the sessions, theft the cookies, ...
# Persistent (Stored) XSS

1. Store the JS on the website
2. Causing every user access this website runs the JavaScript code
# Damage Caused by XSS
1. Web defacing
2. Spoofing requests
3. Stealing information

## Example: My Space
Sammy put a JS code in the profile. Everyone who read the profile will copy the code to their profile. **“Self-Propagating XSS Worm”**

## How to create self-propagating worm? 
### Document Object Model (DOM) Approach
Use document.getElementByID() to copy the node to her own profile

## Self-Propagating XSS Worm: The Link Approach


# Countermeasure

## the Filter approach
Removes code from user inputs.

## the Encoding approach
```
- Converts <script> alert(‘XSS’) </script> to &lt;script&gt;alert(‘XSS’)
```
## Defeating XSS using Content Security Policy

1. Force the website DO NOT USE inline script
2. Force the website only use the inline JavaScript with a nonce value (random value)

# Race Condition Definition
- Multiple process manipulate the same data concurrently
- If program has race condition, attackers can affect the output of the privileged program. 
# Special Case
## TOCTTOU (Time of Check to Time of Use)
- Between ACCESS CHECK and USE, data may have been changed
- Like bank withdraw the same time? 
- Also if someone put 500 at counter, the service guy is back with the product, the customer takes 100 back, but the service guy still think that is 500
## Security implication
- While the mediator is checking the access rights for my_file, the user changes the file name to your_file and action to “Delete”.
## Privileged programs
- Some program has higher privilege than the users
- Ex. 假设说我有一个Windows系统，那么Windows系统里把我设为管理员的程序，就是一个Privilege程序

### Set-UID Concept
- Allow user to run a program with the program owner’s privilege. 
- Allow users to run programs with temporary elevated privileges

Real UID (RUID): Identifies real owner of process	
Effective UID (EUID): Identifies privilege of a process

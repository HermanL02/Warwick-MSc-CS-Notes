# Race Condition Definition
- Multiple process manipulate the same data concurrently
- If program has race condition, attackers can affect the output of the privileged program. 
# Special Case
## TOCTTOU (Time of Check to Time of Use)
- Between ACCESS CHECK and USE, data may have been changed
- Like bank withdraw the same time? 
- Also if someone put 500 at counter, the service guy is back with the product, the customer takes 100 back, but the service guy still think that is 500
## Security implication
- While the mediator is checking the access rights for my_file, the user changes the file name to your_file and action to “Delete”.
## Privileged programs
- Some program has higher privilege than the users
- Ex. 假设说我有一个Windows系统，那么Windows系统里把我设为管理员的程序，就是一个Privilege程序

### Set-UID Concept
- Allow user to run a program with the program owner’s privilege. 
- Allow users to run programs with temporary elevated privileges

Real UID (RUID): Identifies real owner of process	启动进程的用户
Effective UID (EUID): Identifies privilege of a process 进程的权限
Normal program only use RUID
Set-UID use EUID, so even if RUID is a normal user, but runs a file that only root user has control, the program will run with EUID's privilege, which is the root user

### Race Condition Vulnerability
Goal: Access /etc/passwd
### Issues
1. High speed running program: The time between check resources and use resources is short, so no other operation can be done
2. Symbolic Link: resulting hard to change
3. If we change the permission too early, the access function would know
4. If too late, the program already done the operation to the program, so the attack also would be fail
### How to use the vulnerbility?
To win the race condition (TOCTTOU window), we need two processes :
Run vulnerable program in a loop
Run the attack program

### Example 
1. **A1 和 A2**：这是攻击程序的两个操作。
    - **A1**: 让“/tmp/X”指向攻击者自己拥有的文件。
    - **A2**: 让“/tmp/X”指向系统的“/etc/passwd”文件。此文件是UNIX-like系统中的用户账户信息文件，常常是攻击目标。
2. **V1 和 V2**：这是易受攻击的程序的两个操作。
    - **V1**: 检查用户在“/tmp/X”上的权限。
    - **V2**: 打开这个文件。
3. **交错执行**：由于两个程序在多核机器上同时运行，所以它们的指令可能会交错。这意味着，在易受攻击的程序检查文件权限和实际打开文件之间，攻击程序可能改变“/tmp/X”的指向。
4. **成功的攻击场景**：考虑这样一个执行序列 - A1（攻击者设置他们自己的文件），V1（易受攻击的程序检查并发现它有权限），A2（攻击者快速更改链接指向“/etc/passwd”），V2（易受攻击的程序打开它认为是安全的文件，但实际上是“/etc/passwd”）

## Counter Measure
### Atomic Operations
These two options combined together will not open the specified file if the file already exists.
## Sticky Symlink Protection


## Principle of Least Privilege
**Our vulnerable program has more privileges than required while opening the file.**
变相减少了privilege program的调用次数

### Can be used on buffer overflow counter measure?

No, because the buffer overflow attacker can add this back

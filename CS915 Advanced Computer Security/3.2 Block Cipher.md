# Pre-Lecture Questions Oct. 17
1. Given a k-letter key in the Vigenère cipher, what is the recurrence period? ANS. k letter
2. One way to construct a stream cipher is to use a linear feedback shift register. Given a k-bit key, what's the longest possible recurrence period? ANS. 2^(k-1)
3. The DVD encryption system was broken. Which of the following is correct? 
**a. The cipher used ais a synchronous stream cipher. 
b. The cipher combines two LFSRs. 
c. It was designed to provide 40-bit security. 
d. It is a known-plaintext attack. 
e. The cipher only provide 16-bit security.** 
4. Which of the following about DES are correct? 
**DES has key size of 56-bit. 
DES has block size is 64. 
DES is not a secure cipher and should not be used in today's applications.** 
5. What is the key advantage of Feistel network. 
a. The same network can be repeated many times to increase security. 
b. The encryption and decryption can be parallelized. 
**c. The encryption and decryption can use the same hardware.** 
d. It supports very fast encryption and decryption on hardware. 
# Block cipher

- Canonical examples:
    

- DES: n=64 bits k=56 bits
    
- 3DES: n=64 bits k=168 bits
    
- AES: n=128 bits k=128, 192, 256 bits
    

# PRF and PRP 

# Example
AES:   K × X  →  X  where      K = X = {0,1}$^{128}$
3DES:   K × X  →  X  where      X = {0,1}$^{64}$ ,  K = {0,1}$^{168}$
- A PRP is a PRF where 
1. X = Y
2. It is invertible

# Feistel Network

1. 分割
2. 扩展置换
3. 子密钥混合
4. 非线性转换
5. 合并
6. 交换
## 优势
### 1. 反转性
L<sub>i+1</sub> = R<sub>i</sub>
R<sub>i+1</sub> = L<sub>i</sub> xor F(K<sub>i</sub>, R<sub>i</sub>)

R<sub>i</sub>= L<sub>i+1</sub> 
L<sub>i</sub> = R<sub>i+1</sub> xor F(K<sub>i</sub>, R<sub>i</sub>)
   = F(K<sub>i</sub>, L<sub>i+1</sub> )
F是轮函数，Ki是每次的key

## DES
56 bits Key -> Key Scheduling -> 48 bits key 
Original text -> 48 bits key -> 16 rounds Feistel Network -> Cipher Text
**Same for decrypt**

## 2. 灵活性

## F function?

### S-box
### P-box

Choosing S-boxes and P-box


## Brute-force
1999: 22 hours to break
**Conclusion: 56-bit is too weak (128-bit key is the standard)**

# Pre-Lecture Questions Oct. 10

1. According to Shannon, what are the two key principles to design a secure cipher? ANS. a. Relationships between the input and output should be obscured. d. letters in the cipher text should be uniformly distributed. 
2. What is the key size of Caesar cipher?  ANS. 0 Explanation: Because there is no key, it is fixed to 3 digits
3. What is the key size of ROT13?  ANS. 0 Explanation: Same above
# Cryptography

- Art and Science of keeping information secure
- The secrecy must reside entirely on the key, not the cipher algorithm.
# Basic terminology
## Cipher
A cryptographic algorithm
## Key
Used for Encryption and Decryption
## Keyspace
The range of the key

## Cryptanalysis
Analyze the weak part. aka. Attack
## Cryptology
Cryptology = Cryptography + Cryptanalysis

# Four general types of attack
## 1. Ciphertext-only attack
Attacker **ONLY** access **Cipher**, and they use their knowledge about the plaintext to do the attack (ex. **Frequency Analysis**)

## 2. Known-plaintext attack
Ex. German ciphertext started with a date

## 3. Chosen-plaintext attack
Ex. The US military let midway send **Fake** news, say Midway is short of water. Then Japan use **AF** represents midway to send the cipher text. 

## 4. Chosen-ciphertext attack
Ex. Send a random code, let the enemy decrypt the message, and compare these messages

# Brute Force? 

Brute force now cannot break the modern encryption methods. 

Ex. If I want to brute-force a 256-bit key with 1 billion keys/millisecond, it would cost $2^{192}$ years

# Roadmap

## Symmetric cryptography
## -  Classical cryptography
## - Stream cipher 
## - Block cipher I, II  
## - Hash 
## - MAC 
## Asymmetric cryptography
## - Public key encryption 
## - Digital signature 
## - Key agreement


# Classical cryptography
based on characters (human) 
# Modern cryptography 
based on binary inputs 

# Confusion  and Diffusion
## Confusion 
Obscures the relationship between the plaintext and the ciphertext E.g. Substitution

With Good Confusion: 
Key 1 => Plaintext: A => Cyphertext: B
Key 2 => Plaintext: A => Cyphertext: Z

Without Good Confusion: 
Key 1 => Plaintext: A => Cyphertext: B
Key 2 => Plaintext: A => Cyphertext: B
## Diffusion 
With Good Diffusion: 
Plaintext: 12 => Cyphertext: 78
Plaintext: 13 => Cyphertext: 45
Without Good Diffusion: 
Plaintext: 12 => Cyphertext: 33
Plaintext: 13 => Cyphertext: 34


# Substitution ciphers

## Monoalphabetic cipher 
a->b, b->c
## Polyalphabetic cipher 
Several monoalphabetic ciphers

# Monoalphabetic ciphers 
## Caesar Cipher 
## ROT13 
Decryption is basically encrypt it again

## Modular arithmetic 
a is congruent to b modulo m => $a≡b(mod m)$

## Data range 
For our purpose, the data range is non-negative

## Shift cipher 
K=3-> Caesar cipher; 
K = 13 -> ROT13
**Can be broken by exhaustive search, only 26 possible keys**


## Substitution cipher 

## Key Space 
What is the key space? 26! 

## Weakness  
Frequency. All characters are not uniformly distributed. 


# Polyalphabetic cipher 
## Vigenère cipher 
## Definition 
Step1: Choose a Key word
Step2: Consider each of them as a number (from 1-26)
Step3: Encrypt
Ex. Plaintext: Hello -> Key: Key -> Cipher: RIJVS

## Weakness and Attacks 
### Kasiski Test 
Step1. There are some texts are the repeating. For example, "the". 
Step2. Then we count the space between them. For example, if all the Thes appears at 0, 165, 235, 275, 285...If all of them can be divided by 15, then we could make a guess that the key is the factor of 15. 

### Index of coincidence 
### Formula
  ![[Pasted image 20231010114405.png]]
 
### Index of coincidence analysis
Normal English is 0.065
Completely random is 0.038
Normal English shifted by a fix number is 0.065
Encrypted by Vigenère cipher is between 0.038 to 0.065

### Steps to break 
Step1. Change Plaintext to Matrix, e.g. abcdef... to 2 cols
ab
cd
ef
..
then to 3cols
abc
def
...
then to 4 cols
abcd
efgh
....
then to 5 cols, 6 cols ...

Step2. Calculate the columns index of coincidence, see which one is close to 0.065

Step3. Do the frequency analysis

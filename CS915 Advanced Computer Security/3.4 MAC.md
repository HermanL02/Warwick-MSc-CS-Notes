# Ways to contruct MAC
## Block Cipher
CBC-MAC
Why Fixed IV, not random? If we use random IV, we cannot generate a new MAC without knowing the key. 
## Hash
1. Mac 
MAC tag = H(k, m[0]||m[1]||m[2])
If the recipient only verify the MAC but not the length of the message, the malware can edit the message and the recipient does not know. 
**MAC tag = H(m, k)** Still in secure
2. HMAC
Basic intuition
- Need to have a secret key to protect the front
- Need to have a secret key to protect the end
Resulting: **H(k1, H(k2, m))**

How to make it efficient? 
HMAC
- Use only one secret key (hence efficient)
**HMAC(k,m) = H( k⊕opad  ll  H( k⊕ipad ll m ) )**

### Attack on HMAC
Keyczar crypto library  (Python) 
def Verify(key, msg, sig_bytes):
	return HMAC(key, msg) == sig_bytes

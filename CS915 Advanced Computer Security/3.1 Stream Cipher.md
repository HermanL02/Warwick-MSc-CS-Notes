# Pre-Lecture Questions Oct. 12
1. What is the key size of a shift cipher? ANS. 26
2. What is the key size of a substitution cipher? ANS. 26!
3. A substitution cipher can be broken by frequency analysis ANS. Yes
4. Which principle is missing in the design of the substitution cipher? ANS. Diffusion
5. How to find out the length of the key in a Vigenère cipher? ANS. The two methods in the previous lecture [[3. Crypto toolbox]]

# Definition
Encrypt individual letters one at a time
# Classification
## The one-time pad 
One time pad is unbreakable. 
###  Discrete Probability
A finite sample would have S = {S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, ..., S<sub>3</sub>}
The probability distribution P on S is {P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, ..., P<sub>n</sub>} 
Event E would have a probability of P(e)=P(E) , the complement event would be 1-P(E)
### Joint probability
P[E<sub>1</sub> ∪ E] 
## Synchronous stream cipher 

## Self-synchronizing stream cipher

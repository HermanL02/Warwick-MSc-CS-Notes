# Pre-Lecture Questions Oct. 16
1. A stream cipher requires synchronisation for it to work. ANS. No
2. Which of the following about one-time pad are correct? 
ANS. (in bold)
**It is a stream cipher**
**It satisfied the perfect secrecy.** 
It is used in practical applications. 
==**The output is uniformly distributed.**==  这个特别注意
It is possible to use a key shorter than the length of the message. 
3. What is the main difference between a one-time pad and a stream cipher? ANS. Length of the key
4. Given a cipher text produced by using a stream cipher, an attacker can modify the plaintext to be decrypted without knowing the key. ANS. 
# Definition
Encrypt individual letters one at a time
# Classification
## The one-time pad 
One time pad is unbreakable. 
###  Discrete Probability
A finite sample would have S = {S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, ..., S<sub>3</sub>}
The probability distribution P on S is {P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, ..., P<sub>n</sub>} 
Event E would have a probability of P(e)=P(E) , the complement event would be 1-P(E)
### Joint probability
P[E<sub>1</sub>∩E<sub>2</sub>], Two events are mutually exclusive

### Conditional probability 
$$
P( E_ {1}  |E_ {2}  )=  \frac {P(E_ {1}\cap E_ {2})}{P(E_ {2})} 

$$

### Bayes Theorem 


### Perfect Secrecy 

**From Bayes Theorem P(m|c) = P(c|m)P(m)/P(c). It suffices to show P(c|m) = P(c).**
**P(c|m) = P(m⊕k|m) = P(k) = 1/|K|.**
P(c = 0 | m = 0) = P(k = 0) = 1/2
P(c = 1 | m = 0) = P(k = 1) = 1/2
P(c = 0 | m = 1) = P(k = 1) = 1/2
P(c = 1 | m = 1) = P(k = 0) = 1/2
**P(c) = ∑P(mi)P(ki) = 1/|K|∑P(mi) = 1/|K|**
P(c = 0) = P(m=0)P(k=0) + P(m=1)P(k=1) = 0.3 * 0.5+ 0.7 * 0.5 = 0.5

### Drawbacks 
Perfect but impractical, only 1 time

### Stream ciphers - making OTP practical
Idea: use short key generate long key stream
## Synchronous stream cipher 
![[Pasted image 20231012134524.png]]
## Definition 
We can generate key stream using a linear recurrence of degree m, where c<sub>0</sub> ... c<sub>m-1</sub> are constants. 
### Recurrence 
Similar to Vigenère **What’s the recurrence period of Vigenère cipher?** ANS. n

### Example 
Starting with 1, 0, 0, 0, we can get 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 

### Hardware implementation 
We can use it as Linear Feedback Shift Register. LFSR
### Attack on stream cipher: two-time pad 
The mistake of re-using the same key
c1 = m1  ==符号== f(k)
c2 = m2 ==符号== f(k)
c1 ==符号== c2 = m1 ==符号== m2 => {m1, m2}

### Attack 2: No integrity 
Get the key using XOR, then change the destination to another one. 

### Attack 3: Weakness in the algorithm

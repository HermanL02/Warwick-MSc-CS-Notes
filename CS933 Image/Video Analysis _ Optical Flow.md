Estimating motion using Optical Flow
# Optical Flow
- A technique for estimating local motions
- It produces Velocity or flow fields. 
	- Predict motions of object between frames to enable object tracking
	- Estimate object shape changes and deformations
	- Produce motion features for recognising gestures

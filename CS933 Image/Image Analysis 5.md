# Multiresolution
- Hierarchical Computations
- Pyramids
- Discrete Cosine Transforms

# Smoothing and Subsampling
We can combine the subsample and smooth to build a image ==Pyramid==

# REDUCE operation

## Def
REDUCE is done by smoothing and sub-sampling
it recursively to build a set of pyramid levels. 

# EXPAND operation

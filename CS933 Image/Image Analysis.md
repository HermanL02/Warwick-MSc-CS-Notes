## Acquisition of images

- Sensors acquire image data
- Visible Spectrum
- Non-visible modalities (X-ray, Radar, Lidar)

## Image dimensions

- Spatial: 2D, 3D
- Spatial and time: 2D+t (video), 3D+t (dynamic MRI)
- Spatial with depth: 2D+depth (Kinect, time-of-flight: Radar, Lidar)
- Stereo: 2D cameras or Multiple cameras (Light-field)
- Multi-spectral, e.g. satellite images, biomedical imagery

## Data rates and data compression

- Data rates: in bps
- CD 44.1KHz (44,100 times per second)
- Each sample is 16-bits
- Total: 705.6 Kbps
- 127Mb for a 3 minute song => **Large**
- MP3: Trade off **Quality** and **Compression Rate** => Distortion

## Challenges of sampling, quantisation and size

- Size and Compression
- Denoising
- Interpretation: Detection and Understanding

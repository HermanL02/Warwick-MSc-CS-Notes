# Feature Detection and Matching
- Used on describe, search and recognise objects in image and videos
- How to Describe? 
	- colour, texture, shape, size
 No, these are high level, so how about low levels? 
# Cluttered Scene
- Surf Feature
- Note that any feature representation has to be invariant to transformations: **rotation, translation, scale, projective**
# Visual Features 
- Distinctive
- Pose Invariant: Even if it is rotated, scaled or skewed
- Local: small part so even there is a partial photo we can understand
- Repeatable: Invariant to all the objects
# Harris-Stephens Corner Detector

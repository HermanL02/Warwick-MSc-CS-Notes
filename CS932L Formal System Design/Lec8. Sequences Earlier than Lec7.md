# Sequence
1. Not just a set
2. Tracks may be repeated
3. order is important
## Modelling 
### As a function
Uniquely identify the position
[tt3,tt27,tt14,tt3,tt8]
first track: tt3, second: tt27...
n-long sequence -> as function -> from 1...n
==Reordering and repeating== elements in the set gives ==exactly the same set and same sequence==
### As an operation
